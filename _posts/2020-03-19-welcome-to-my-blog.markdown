Welcome to my first blog post.

In this blog, I will share some computer science related articles. That includes some low level stuff, as well as technologies related topics. I am a software engineering student whose goal is to learn how everything in computers work. From hardware and processors, kernels and OS to software development and cloud computing. I created this blog so i can share with people things that i learned and are not easily available on the net, or to simplify topics that appear to be complicated for students like me.

So follow me through my journey, learning new stuff and sharing it with you.
